The bot utilizes a conversation handler to prompt users for verification and responds to user messages with context-aware replies generated by OpenAI's ChatGPT model.

## Features
- **Telegram Integration**: The bot communicates with users through the Telegram messaging platform, allowing seamless interaction via text messages.
- **Verification Process**: Before engaging in conversation, the bot prompts users for verification by asking predefined questions. Once verified, users can proceed to ask questions or interact with the bot.
- **OpenAI Integration**: The bot leverages OpenAI's ChatGPT model to generate context-aware responses based on user messages and the bot's training data.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Telegram Python Library (`python-telegram-bot`)
